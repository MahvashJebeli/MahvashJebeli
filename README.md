## About me 👋🙋‍♀️👩‍💻
I love life and data! I still become excited about science like a five-year-old would for ice cream; this is how my coworkers describe me, spreading positive energy and joy to people around me. I believe every day is an opportunity to learn something new, make a better version of myself, and never give up on my thirst to learn. My life goal, not only through my education but also through my extracurricular activities, is to increase the standards of human life. I believe working with data in the biopharma/biotech/healthcare industry is one of the best ways to achieve such a goal. 
## What I do 💻
I am a data scientist with vast knowledge and experience in biological systems (a PhD and two Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering), in addition to expertise in working with data. Currently, I work as a data scientist for Amgen. As the main focus of my job, I lead scalable automation of Design History Files (DHF) development, leveraging Generative AI, LLMs (ChatGPT-4o), NLP (including knowledge graphs), SQL and Spark to process, access, and later upload large datasets on AWS servers. This effort resulted in a remarkable 95% human effort. As part of this initiative, I developed a Python class on Databricks for statistical analysis and cloud computing. Daily I use different Python libraries (such as pandas), GitLab (for code version control), Databricks, and AWS (s3) to access the large datasets. On the side, I develop and validate Spotfire scripts for conducting biostatistical analysis. The cherry on top for me is mentoring and Training Junior Team members.
## List of my personal projects 📑
#### A work in progress! Is there any end to the learning, though? 🤷‍♀️
### Machine Learning:
* Analyzed different datasets using various machine learning algorithms, including KNN, SVM, classification, and regression, utilizing the scikit-learn library and matplotlib to visualize. Additionally, the algorithms were built from scratch to compare with the built-in ones. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/ML-algorithms)
* Investigated a large genomics dataset of different cancer line’s gene expressions to predict cancer type. Utilized scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy libraries in Python. SVM and clustering algorithms (with PCA) were employed. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Gene_Expressions_ML_Algorithms)
### Deep Learning:
* Developed a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow to classify images into different groups and make predictions. The model was trained using cloud computing (Google Colab) and cross-validation technique. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Deep_Learning)
### Natural Language Processing:
* Developed a natural language processing model using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow to make predictions about the sarcasm level of any given sentence. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-)
