## About me 👋🙋‍♀️👩‍💻
I love life and data! I still become excited about science like a five-year-old would for ice cream; this is how my coworkers describe me, spreading positive energy and joy to people around me. I believe every day is an opportunity to learn something new, make a better version of myself, and never give up on my thirst to learn. My life goal, not only through my education but also through my extracurricular activities, is to increase the standards of human life. I believe working with data in the biopharma/biotech/healthcare industry is one of the best ways to achieve such a goal. 
## What I do 💻
I worked as a data scientist in a biotech company for 1.5 years. Recently, I was laid off as a part of a 41% reduction of workforce by the company. I am looking for my next challenge and opportunity as a data scientist in the biotech industry.
## List of my projects 📑
#### A work in progress! Is there any end to the learning, though? 🤷‍♀️
### - Machine Learning:
* Analyzed different datasets using various machine learning algorithms, including KNN, SVM, classification, and regression, utilizing the scikit-learn library and matplotlib to visualize. Additionally, the algorithms were built from scratch to compare with the built-in ones. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/ML-algorithms)
* Investigated a large genomics dataset of different cancer line’s gene expressions to predict cancer type. Utilized scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy libraries in Python. SVM and clustering algorithms (with PCA) were employed. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Gene_Expressions_ML_Algorithms)
### - Deep Learning:
* Developed a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow to classify images into different groups and make predictions. The model was trained using cloud computing (Google Colab) and cross-validation technique. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Deep_Learning)
### - Natural Language Processing:
* Developed a natural language processing model using convolutional neural networks and TensorFlow to make predictions about the sarcasm level of any given sentence. [GitHub](https://github.com/MahvashJebeli/Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-)
## My skills 📜
